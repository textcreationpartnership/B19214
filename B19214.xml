            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He last time that I was in this place, and the last thing that I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto you, was the businesse of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I was in good hope that I should not have need again to have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48238:3"/>put you in minde of that businesse; But still seeing the slow proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings therein, and the daily Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatches that I have out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the lamentable estate of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Subjects there, I cannot but again earnestly recommend the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch of that Expedition unto you, for it is the chief Businesse that at this time I take to heart, and there cannot (almost) be any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse that I can have more care of. I might now take up some of your time in expressing my detestation of Rebellions in generall, and of this in particular; But knowing that Deeds and not Declarations must suppresse this great Insolencie, I do here in a word offer you what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever my power, paines, or indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48238:3"/>can contribute to this good and necessary work of reducing the Irish Nation to their true and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted obedience.</p>
            <p>And that nothing may be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on my part, I must here take notice of the Bill for pressing of Souldiers, now depending among you my Lords, concerning which I here declare, That in case it come so to Me, as it may not infringe or diminish my Prerogative, I will passe it: And further seeing there is a dispute raised (I being little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him whosoever at this time began it) concerning the bounds of this ancient and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Prerogative, to avoide further debate at this time, I offer, that the Bill may passe with a <hi>Salvo
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48238:4"/>jure,</hi> both for King and People, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving such debates to a time that may better bear it. If this be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, the fault is not mine that this Bill passe not; but those that refuse so fair an offer.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I conjure you by all that is, or can be dear to you or me, that, laying away all disputes, you go on cheerfully and speedily for the reducing of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
